IMS
====
IMS is a body which helps define technical standards for various things, including e-learning material. The IMS Content Packaging specification makes it possible to store chunks of material in a standard format which can be re-used in different systems, without having to convert the material into new formats.

The IMS content package in Moodle enables such content packages to be uploaded and included in Moodle courses. There are various options for displaying content with a navigation menu or buttons etc.

Adding an IMS content package
------------------------------
You can add an IMS Content package to a course by choosing it from the "Add an activity or resource" link (or, if not present, the "Add a resource" drop down menu.) All settings may expanded by clicking the "Expand all" link top right.
