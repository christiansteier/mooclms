Recent files
=============
The recent files repository allows users quickly to locate files they uploaded previously.

Using Recent files
--------------------
    * Recent files can be accessed anywhere the file picker is available.
    * Recent files are context-sensitive -that is to say - you will only see the type of file Moodle thinks you want to upload.
    
*Example 1:* A user clicks the image icon in the text (TinyMCE) editor to upload an image already used in a different course. The Recent files repository will only show image files even though the user might have uploaded files of other types previously. 

*Example 2:* A user clicks the Moodle media icon to upload a sound file already used in a different course. The Recent files repository will only show media files even though the user might have uploaded files of other types previously. 

When a recently uploaded file is re-used elsewhere in Moodle, the teacher has the option to make a copy (a new, unconnected version) or to create a shortcut or alias.

    * There is no set time for the display of Recent files - that is to say - it isn't the last two days or two weeks etc.
    * Recent files are by default the last 50 files the user has uploaded to Moodle. This number can be changed by the admin 
    

Changing the number of Recent files
-------------------------------------
    1. Go to Settings > Site Administration > Plugins > Repositories > Recent Files
    2. Click the blue Settings link
    3. Change the number to your preferred number. 
    
Disabling Recent files
------------------------
Recent files is enabled by default but can be disabled by the administrator if required. 

    * Go to *Settings > Site Administration > Plugins > Repositories > Manage Repositories*
    * Change the drop down next to Recent files from "Enabled and Visible" to "Disabled" 

Repository capabilities
-------------------------
There is just one capability, View recent files, which is allowed for the default authenticated user role.
