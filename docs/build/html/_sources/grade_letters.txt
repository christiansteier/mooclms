Grade Letters
===============
Grade letters, also called letter grades, are symbols used to represent a range of grades. For example "A" could be used to represent grades of 80% and above, "B" to represent grades between 70 and 80%, "C" to represent grades between 50 and 70%, and so on. Alternatively, you could have "Pass" for grades above 50% and "Fail" for grades below 50%.
