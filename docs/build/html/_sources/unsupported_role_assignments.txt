Unsupported Role Assignment
============================
Unsupported role assignments are role assignments in contexts that make no sense for that role, such as the course creator role in the course or activity context, or the teacher role in the user context. 

An administrator can check for any unsupported role assignments across the site in *Settings > Site administration > Users > Permissions > Unsupported role assignments*.
