Wiki
=====
A wiki is a collection of collaboratively authored web documents. Basically, a wiki page is a web page everyone in your class can create together, right in the browser, without needing to know HTML. A wiki starts with one front page. Each author can add other pages to the wiki by simply creating a link to a page that doesn't exist yet. 

In Moodle, wikis can be a powerful tool for collaborative work. The entire class can edit a document together, creating a class product, or each student can have their own wiki and work on it with you and their classmates. 

Adding a wiki
--------------
  * With the editing turned on, in the section you wish to add your wiki, click the "Add an activity or resource" link (or, if not present, the "Add an activity" drop down menu ) and choose *Wiki*.
  * This will take you to the wiki settings page titled "Adding a new wiki". All settings may expanded by clicking the "Expand all" link top right.
  * In an existing wiki, the wiki settings can be found in *Administration > Wiki administration > Edit settings*.
