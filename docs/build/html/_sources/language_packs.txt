Language Packs
===============
Over 100 language packs are available for an administrator to install on your Moodle site via *Administration > Site administration > Language > Language packs*. Simply select the languages you require from the list of available language packs and click on the "Install selected language pack" button.

Multiple language packs may be selected for install by holding down the Apple or Ctrl key whilst clicking on the language packs. 

All language packs, apart from English, are stored in moodledata/lang folder. 

Parent language packs
----------------------
Certain language packs contain only the modified language strings from their parent language, rather than a complete set. Thus, it is necessary to install the parent language pack too. These language packs are:

    * de_du, de_kids and de_comm (which requires de)
    * fr_ca (which requires fr)
    * en_us, en_ar, en_kids (which requires the default en) 
    
    
Manual language pack installation
-----------------------------------
Language packs may also be installed manually by downloading the zip file from http://download.moodle.org/langpack/ to a directory called *lang* in your *moodledata* directory and then unzipping. 


Language pack updates
----------------------
    * Language packs can be updated via *Administration > Site administration > Language > Language packs*.
    * You can see which language packs have updates because they are listed in both 'Installed language packs' and 'Available language packs'.
    * To update all installed language packs (except English and any local language packs) click the 'Update all installed language packs' button.
    * For sites with a large number of language packs installed, to update just a few installed language packs at a time, select the languages from the 'Available language packs' list and click the 'Install selected language pack(s)' button.
    * The English language pack is updated automatically each time the site is upgraded.
    * As most language packs are a work in progress, it is usually a good idea to update them regularly. Once a week/month might be a good frequency.
