==================
Location: External database edit settings link in *Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Enrolments > Manage enrol plugins*

You may use a external database (of nearly any kind) to control your enrolments. It is assumed your external database contains a field containing a course ID, a field containing a user ID, and optionally a field containing a role. These are compared against fields that you choose in the local course, user tables, and role tables.
