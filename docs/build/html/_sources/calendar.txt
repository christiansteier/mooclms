Calendar
=========
The calendar can display site, course, group and or user events in addition to assignment and quiz deadlines, chat times and other course events.

A calendar may be included in a course or the site Front page by adding a Calendar block or an Upcoming Events block. 

Preference settings
---------------------
Both the daily detail screen and the monthly detail screen have the Preferences button in the upper right. Here you can set the time format, first day of the week, number of events to show in the calendar block, days to look forward for events and if the filters on this calendar should be saved as the default for all calendars. 

Site administration settings
------------------------------
The following settings can be changed by a site administrator in *Administration > Appearance > Calendar*

**Admins see all**
Whether admins see all calendar events or just those that apply to themselves.

**Time display format**
Whether a 12 or 24 hour format is used. This setting can be overridden by user preferences.

**Start of week**
Default is Sunday.

**Weekend days**
Weekend days are shown in a different colour.

**Days and events to look ahead**
