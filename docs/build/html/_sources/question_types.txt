Question types
===============
You may add a variety of different types of questions in the Quiz and Lesson modules. This page is about Quiz module question types; some will be similar to Lesson questions types, which are fewer in number and function differently. The standard quiz question types are listed below with brief descriptions. **Please use the links on the right side of this page to find more detailed information about standard questions types**.
