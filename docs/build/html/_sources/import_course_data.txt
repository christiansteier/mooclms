Import course data
====================
Course activities and resources may be imported from any other course that the teacher has editing permissions in. This will allow teachers to re-use instead of re-creating one or more :ref:`activities <activities>` or :ref:`resources <resources>`.

Import course data is similar to a backup and restore process and does not include any user data. 

How to import activities or resources
---------------------------------------
 * In *Administration > Course Administration*, click on the *Import* link.

 * You should see the "Import complete. Click continue to return to the course." message, or an error message indicating that the import process did not take place.
 
Examples and tips
-------------------
 * Importing a quiz from course A to course B, will also add the questions to the question bank so you can use them in new quizzes.
 * Groups can also be imported as a batch from a file.
 * It may be necessary to check all Activities (Forums, Assignments, etc.) to assure they are now using HTML format. Due to the change in the HTML editor from 1.9 to 2.2, editing of Activities comes up as "Moodle Auto-format" which displays the HTML version of the Description. Once the "Moodle Auto-format" has been changed to "HTML format" the new HTML editor is available by default when editing.
