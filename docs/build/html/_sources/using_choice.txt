Using Choice
=============

What the student sees
----------------------
 * When a teacher has created a Choice activity, the student is presented with a number of radio buttons. They click one to make their selection.
 * Depending on the teacher's settings, the student may then be able to see the results either anonymously or with names (via the "View xxx responses" link) or not see anything.

What the teacher sees
----------------------
 * Regardless of how it's been set for students, a teacher will always see user names and choices, via the "View xxx responses" link.
 * The teacher is also able to delete selected choices or download them in various formats as in the screenshot below.

Examples of using choice
--------------------------

**Gather pre-event comments**

 * A simple question to answer, to kick start - the beginning of a lesson.
 * Gather initial comments, reasons for taking course, participating in event.
 
**Registrar and Administration uses**

Currently Moodle Choices is offering a far greater contribution to our admin functions than our teaching.(remember not to use groups in this function)

Elective courses: students are given a list of choices that they can choose from
 
**Use with podcasts and videos**

Include podcasts or videos as well as images in the choice activity. 

**Elections**

It is possible to run student union elections using choice module.
