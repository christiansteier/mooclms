.. _file_settings:

File
=====
The file module has additional settings which may be changed by an administrator in *Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > File*.

Frame height
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you can specify the height of the top frame (containing the navigation) if you choose the "in frame" display option. Note: If your theme has a large header then the resource_framesize variable should be increased to prevent horizontal and vertical scrollbars.

Require activity description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This setting allows you to turn off the requirement for users to type something into the description box.

Available display options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This setting allows you to add different ways the resource may be displayed on the course page. By default Moodle doesn't enable "New window" or "In frame", so you need to set them available here if required, and you can also disable other options if not applicable.

Default values for activity settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you can set the defaults for this resource. You can also choose which setting(s) to class as "Advanced". These settings will only then appear if the user clicks "Show More" in the settings.
