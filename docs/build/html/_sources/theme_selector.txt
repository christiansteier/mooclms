Theme Selector
===============
An administrator can set a theme for the site in *Administration > Site administration > Appearance > Themes > Theme selector*.

Different themes may be set according to 'device type' - default, legacy (for older browsers), mobile and tablet. 

    * Click on the "Select theme" button next to the type you wish to change
    * Scroll down to see the previews of the available themes and click on the "Use theme" button to chose the theme
    * The next screen will provide information about the theme. Click "Continue" 

**Note 1:** Moodle caches themes so if you don't immediately see changed settings that you were expecting, click the "Clear theme caches" button at the top of the Theme selector page.

**Note 2:** The selected theme may be overridden if user/course or category themes have been allowed in the Theme settings.
