Language Settings
==================
You are here: *Administration > Site Administrations > Language> Language Settings* .

These settings allow you to specify the languages required. You can select specific language packs.

Site administration settings
-----------------------------
   * Language autodetect - By default, Moodle detects a user's language from their browser setting. However, language auto-detection may be disabled so that the default site language is used instead.

   * Default language - This sets the default language for the site. This setting can be overridden by users using the language menu or the setting in their user profile.

     **Note:** If a preferred language is set in your browser then this will override the default site language (unless language auto-detection is disabled). 

   * Display language menu - This sets whether the language menu is displayed on the login page and the home page. If this is turned off, the only places where a user can change the language setting is in their user profile or in the course settings if they are a teacher.

   * Languages on the language menu - If you want to limit the number of languages students and teachers can select from, enter a reduced list here. 
   
   * Cache language menu - If enabled, the list of available translations is cached.
   
   * Cache all language strings - Caches all the language strings into compiled files in the data directory. If you are translating Moodle or changing strings in the Moodle source code then you may want to switch this off. Otherwise leave it on to see performance benefits.
   
   * Sitewide locale - It's generally best to leave this setting empty, as it's set through each language pack.

   * Excel encoding - Leave as default (Unicode) unless you have a particular reason for wanting Latin encoding.
