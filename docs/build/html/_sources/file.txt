File
=====
When you wish to share with your students a simple file such as a Word-processed document or slideshow (eg created in MS Word, Powerpoint, or Open Office) you use the file resource type. It allows you to upload and display a variety of resources on your course. How your students access them depends on your choices in File resource settings. Note also that they will only be able to open your files if they have the appropriate software on their own computers. 

Adding a file
--------------
To add a file to your course 

**Quick method:** (Note - does not work with Internet Explorer 9 or lower)

  1. Click the 'Turn editing on' button at the top right of the course page
  2. Drag and drop the file onto the course section where you'd like it to appear
  3. If necessary, edit the title of the file by clicking the pencil icon, or edit other options (see below) by clicking the editing icon 

**Longer method:**

  1. Click the 'Turn editing on' button at the top right of the course page
  2. Click 'Add an activity or resource' link, then in the activity chooser, select file then click the Add button (or select file from the "Add a resource" dropdown menu) All settings may expanded by clicking the "Expand all" link top right.

General
^^^^^^^^

**Name**

Whatever you type here will form the link learners click on to view the file so it is helpful to give it a name that suggests its purpose.

**Description**

Add a description of your file here if desired (or required.) Click "Show editing tools" to display the rich text editor, and drag the bottom right of the text box out to expand it.

**Display description on the course page**

If this box is ticked, the description will appear on the course page just below the name of the file. 

Content
^^^^^^^^
Either drag and drop your file onto the arrow if you are using an appropriate browser, or click on "Add" and use the :ref:`File picker <file_picker>` to upload your file.

(Note that if legacy files were used there will be a setting "Migration of old course file") 

Appearance
^^^^^^^^^^^
(These settings are collapsed by default) 

**Display**

  * **Automatic** - Make the best guess at what should happen (probably what is wanted 99% of the time).
  * **Embed** - Show the Moodle page with heading, blocks and footer. Show the title/description of the item and display the file directly in the page as well (good for images, flash animations, videos?, PDFs).
  * **Force download** - user clicks on the file, then the web browser pops up with the 'where do you want to save this file' box.
  * **Open** - No Moodle heading, blocks, footer or description - just show the file in the web browser (e.g. shows image, PDF, flash animation, taking up the whole browser window)
  * **In pop-up** - Same as 'Open', but opens a new browser window to show this file (without the Moodle heading, blocks, etc) - this browser window also does not have all the menus and address bar in it. 

    The following additional options are only there if you enable them via Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > File: 

    In frame - show the Moodle heading and the file description, with the file displayed in a resizable area below (images, PDF, flash, etc. supported).
    New window - very much like 'in pop-up', but the new window is a full browser window, with menus and address bar, etc. 

All of the above is true of items that can be displayed inside the browser directly (e.g. images, text files, PDFs (with plugin)). If the file cannot be displayed within the browser (e.g. word documents, without a suitable plugin, or other files that need to be loaded by an external program), then the pop-ups or frames, etc. will be created, but then the browser will take over and ask if you want to save the file. 

**Show size type**

To show the file size and/or type on the course page and also on the resource page, simply tick the appropriate checkboxes.

**Pop-up width/height** (This setting is visible when "Show more" is clicked.)

If your file is to be displayed in a pop-up, specify the width and height here.

**Display resource name/description**

To show the resource name and/or description when clicking to access the file, simply tick the appropriate checkboxes.

**Use filters on file content** (This setting is visible when "Show more" is clicked.)

If you wish included media such as images and mp3 to appear embedded in the files then select "all files" or "HTML files only", according to your file types. (Note that this setting may cause problems for some Flash and Java applets.) 

Common module settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(These settings are collapsed by default.)

See :ref:`Common module settings <common_module_settings>`

Restrict access/Activity completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(These settings are collapsed by default)

These settings are visible if :ref:`Conditional activities <conditional_activities_settings>` and :ref:`Activity completion <activity_completion_settings>` have been enabled in the site and the course.

Displaying a website index page
---------------------------------
The file module may be used if you have a folder with linked files such as a website with an index.html file or a flash activity with xml/swf and index file. 

  1. Click the 'Turn editing on' button at the top right of the course page
  2. Drag and drop the zipped folder onto the course section where you'd like it to appear, answer 'Create file resource' to the popup dialogue, then click the upload button
  3. Clicking the editing icon (hand with a pen) then click on the zip file and unzip it
  4. Click on the index.html file or the file you want to start displaying your linked files from then in the popup dialogue click the button 'Set main file'. This ensures this file is the one that appears on the course page for students to click on. The main file is then indicated with a title in bold.
  5. Click the button 'Save and display' at the bottom of the page
