Marking guide options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By checking the appropriate boxes it is possible to allow students to see (or not)the guide definition and how many marks are allocated per criterion. 

Saving and using Marking guide
-------------------------------
Once completed, the guide may be saved as a draft or saved and made ready to use, according to the button selected at the bottom of the screen. 

Editing or deleting Marking guide
-----------------------------------
  * Once completed, a guide may be edited or deleted by going to *Administration > Assignment administration > Advanced grading > Marking guide*. Options appear to edit or delete the currently defined form.
  * When an assignment has been graded, a warning appears if the guide is edited to check whether the assignments need to be regraded or not.

Using templates
----------------
  *Those users with the capability Capabilities/moodle/grade:sharegradingforms (and perhaps Capabilities/moodle/grade:managesharedforms) may save their forms as a template for others to use. They will see an additional option in *Administration > Assignment administration > Advanced grading*.

(Note that teachers do not have these capabilities by default.)

  * If templates have been made available, then on first accessing the Marking guide, teachers may select to "Create a new grading form from a template". This will open up a search box to locate the desired template: 

Duplicating the Marking guide
-------------------------------
Note that when duplicating or restoring a Marking guide, frequently used comments will be duplicated only from Moodle 2.6.2 onwards. Prior to this version they were not copied over. 

Marking assignments
--------------------
When the assignment to be graded is accessed in the usual way, the form appears with the criteria and an empty comments and score box. If frequently used comments have been added, the teacherclicks into the box and then clicks on the required comment to insert it.

How students view the marking guide
-------------------------------------
When students click on an assignment which has a marking guide attached to it, they will see the marking guide as part of the information about their assignment. Thus, they can see the marking guide before they submit.
