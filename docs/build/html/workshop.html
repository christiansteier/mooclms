<p>Workshop is a peer assessment activity with many options. Students submit their work via an online text tool and attachments. There are two grades for a student: their own work and their peer assessments of other students&#8217; work.</p>
<img alt="_images/workshop_1.png" src="_images/workshop_1.png" />
<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Workshop is similar to the Assignment module and extends its functionality in many ways. However, it is recommended that both course facilitator (teacher) and course participants (students) have at least some experience with the Assignment module before the Workshop is used in the course.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>As in the Assignment, course participants submit their work during the Workshop activity. Every course participant submits their own work. The submission may consist of a text and attachments. Therefore, Workshop submission merges both Online text and Upload file types of the Assignment module. Support for team work (in the sense of one submission per group of participants) is out of scope of Workshop module.</li>
<li>The submissions are assessed using a structured assessment form defined by the course facilitator (teacher). Workshop supports several types of assessment forms. All of them allows multi-criteria assessment in comparison to the Assignment module where only one grade is given to a submission.</li>
<li>Workshop supports peer assessment process. Course participants may be asked to assess selected set of their peers&#8217; submissions. The module coordinates the collection and distribution of these assessments.</li>
<li>Course participants get actually two grades in a single Workshop activity - grade for their submission (that is how good their submitted work is) and grade for assessment (that is how well they assessed their peers). Workshop activity creates two grade items in the course Gradebook and they can be aggregated there as needed.</li>
<li>The process of peer assessment and understanding the assessment form can be practised in advance on so called example submissions. These examples are provided by the facilitator together with a reference assessment. Workshop participants can assess these examples and compare their assessment with the reference one.</li>
<li>The course facilitator can select some submissions and publish them so they are available to the others at the end of Workshop activity (in comparison to the Assignment module where submitted work is available only to the author and the facilitator).</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to set the criteria for an assignment, teachers need to fill out an assessment form during the setup phase. Students can view this assessment form in the submission phase and focus on what is important about the task when working on their assignment. In the next phase-the assessment phase, students will assess their peers’ work based on this assessment form.</p>
<p>According to the grading strategy chosen in the grading settings, teachers will get corresponding original assessment form to edit by clicking ‘Edit assessment form’ button in the first page of the workshop setup for the assignment. The grading strategy can be one of <em>Accumulative grading, Comments, Number of errors or Rubrics</em>. Teachers can set each criterion in detail in the assessment form.</p>

<li><strong>Prevent Reviews</strong>: If the teacher wishes for students of the same group to never review each other’s work, as most likely it is their work too in a group submission, then they can check this box and moodle will ensure that they are only allocated other students out of their group’s work to access</li>
<li><strong>Remove current allocations</strong>: Checking this box means that any manual allocations that have been set in the Manual Allocation menu will be removed</li>
<li><strong>Can access with no submission</strong>: Having this box checked allows students to assess other students’ work without having already submitted their own work.</li>
<li><strong>Add self assessments</strong>: This options when checked make sure that as well as assessing other students’ work they must also assess their own. This is a good option to teach students how to be objective to their own work.</li>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>Students can assess example submissions for practice before assessing their peers&#8217; work if this feature is enabled. They can compare their assessments with reference assessments made by the teacher. The grade will not be counted in the grade for assessment.</p>
<p>Teachers need to upload one or more example submissions and the corresponding reference assessment to support this function.</p>
<p>Teachers can also edit the reference assessment later by clicking the ‘re-assess’ button in the first page.</p>
<p><strong>Peer assessment:</strong></p>
<p>If this feature is enabled, a student will be allocated a certain amount of submissions from his peers to assess. He will receive a grade for each assessment, which will be added together with the grade for his own submission and this will be used as his final grade for this assignment.</p>
<p>This is the key feature of workshop: To encourage students to assess the work of their peers and learn from each other. Through this, they will see the strengths of their classmates’ submissions and have a better understanding about how to do a good job. In addition, the advices they get from their peers will give them a more comprehensive view of their own work: The comments from their peers will point out the weakness of their work, which is generally difficult to find out by themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Self-assessment:</strong></p>
<p>If this option is turned on, a student may be allocated his own work to assess. The grade he receives from assessment of his own work will be counted into the grade for assessment, which will be added together with the grade for submission and used to calculate his final grade for this assignment.</p>
<p>This setting enables teachers to see whether students can find out the strength and weakness of their own submissions and judge them objectively. It is a good way to help students think more comprehensively.</p>

<h2>Grading evaluation phase<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-evaluation-phase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here you can choose your settings for calculation of the grade for assessments.</p>
<img alt="_images/workshop_14.png" src="_images/workshop_14.png" />
<div class="section" id="grade-calculation-method">
<h3>Grade calculation method<a class="headerlink" href="#grade-calculation-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This setting determines how to calculate grade for assessments. Currently there is only one option- <em>comparison with the best assessment</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Comparison with the best assessment</em> tries to imagine what a hypothetical absolutely fair assessment would look like.</p>
<p>For example, a teacher uses <em>Number of errors</em> as grading strategy to peer-assess one assignment. This strategy uses a couple of assertions and assessors just need to check if the given assertion is passed or failed. That is, they only need to choose ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for each criterion in the assessment form. In this case, there are three assessors, Alice, Bob and Cindy. And the assessment form contains three criteria. The author will get 100% grade if all the criteria are passed, 75% if two criteria are passed, 25% if only one criterion is passed and 0% if the assessor gives ‘no’ for all three assertions. Here are the assessments they give to one certain work:</p>
<p>Alice: yes/yes/no
Bob: yes/yes/no
Cindy: no/yes/yes</p>
<p>Then the best assessment will be: Yes/yes/no</p>
<p>Second, the workshop will give the best assessment 100% grade. Next it will measure the ‘distance’ from other assessments to this best assessment. The farther the distance, the lower grade the assessment will receive. And <em>Comparison of assessments</em> setting, next to the <em>Grade evaluation setting</em>, will determine how quickly the grade falls down if the assessment differs from the best one.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Comparison with the best assessment</em> method will compare responses to each individual criterion instead of comparing the final grades. In the example above, all of the three assessors give 75% to the submission. However, only Alice and Bob will get 100% grade for their assessments, while Cindy will get a lower grade. Because Alice and Bob agree in individual responses too, while the responses in Cindy’s assessment are different.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparison-of-assessments">
<h3>Comparison of assessments<a class="headerlink" href="#comparison-of-assessments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This setting has 5 options: <em>very lax, lax, fair, strict and very strict</em>. It specifies how strict the comparison of assessment should be. By using <em>comparison with the best assessment</em> method, all assessments will be compared with the best assessment picked up by workshop. The more similar one assessment is with the best assessment, the higher grade this assessment will get, and vice versa. This setting determines how quickly the grades fall down when the assessments differ from the best assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Clear all aggregated grades</strong></p>
<p>Clicking this button will reset aggregated grades for submission and grades for assessment. Teachers can re-calculate these grades from scratch in Grade evaluation phase.</p>
<p><strong>Clear assessments</strong></p>
