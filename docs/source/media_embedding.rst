Media Embedding
=================

Embedding audio and video
---------------------------
Audio and video may be embedded in a course in the following ways:

    * As a file resource
    * As a URL resource with embed as the display option
    * In a lesson popup
    * In any text area using the Moodle media button in the text editor or simply by typing the URL of media file 

The media file link is then replaced with an appropriate multimedia player which can play the resource. 


Enabling media embedding
-------------------------
To enable the embedding of media files, an admin must enable

    1. Appropriate media players (see below)
    2. The Multimedia plugins filter - unless you only want to allow embedding in File, URL and Lesson modules. 
    
    
Site administration settings
------------------------------
An administrator can enable selected media players in Settings > Site administration > Appearance > Media embedding.
