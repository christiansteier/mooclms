Badges
=======
Badges are a good way of celebrating achievement and showing progress. Badges may be awarded based on a variety of chosen criteria and are fully compatible with Mozilla Open Badges. Badges created in Moodle may be displayed on a user's profile or pushed to their Open Badges backpack and public badge collections in their backpack will display in their Moodle profile. 

There are two categories of badges:

    * Site badges - available to users site-wide and related to the site wide activities, like finishing a set of courses.
    * Course badges - available to users enrolled in the course and related to the activities that happen inside the course. 

Badges Settings
----------------

Site administration settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Badges are enabled by default and can be disabled in *Administration > Site administration > Advanced features*.

The site settings for badges are located in *Administration > Site administration > Badges > Badges settings* .

   * Default badge issuer - Here you set the name and email address of the issuer. The name will appear where the badges are displayed and might typically be the name of the organization.

   * Salt for hashing recipient's email address - If a hash is used (numbers and letters only) then backpack services can confirm a badge earner without exposing their email address.
   
   * Enable connection to external backpacks - This should be enabled in order to connect to, for example Mozilla Open Badges. Note that this will not work on a Moodle hosted locally/offline.

   * Enable course badges - Ticking this box will allow teachers to add and manage badges in their courses. 

Course administration settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    * A teacher can add and manage badges in their course if the administrator has enabled course badges in *Administration > Site administration > Badges settings*.
    * They will see a link to badges in *Administration > Course administration > Badges*. where badges may be managed and added.
    
Individual user settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    * A user can manage badges from *Navigation > My profile > My badges*.
    * A user can view available course badges from *Navigation > Current course > Badges*. 


Manage Badges
--------------
Badges may be managed at the course or site level. (Note that teachers in a course cannot by default access site badges unless they have been given a system role with badge managing capabilities). Individual users can manage their badges from their profile. 

See :ref:`managing_badges` for more details.
