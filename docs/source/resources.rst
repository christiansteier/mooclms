Resources
==========
A resource is an item that a teacher can use to support learning, such as a file or link. Moodle supports a range of resource types which teachers can add to their courses. In edit mode, a teacher can add resources via the 'Add an activity or resource' link. Resources appear as a single link with an icon in front of it that represents the type of resource. 

 * :ref:`Book <book>` - Multi-page resources with a book-like format. Teachers can export their Books as IMS CP (admin must allow teacher role to export IMS)
 * :ref:`File <file>` - A picture, a pdf document, a spreadsheet, a sound file, a video file
