Course Backup
==============
A course can be saved with some or all of its parts by using the course backup. Typically, the site administrator will set a schedule of :ref:`automated course backups <automated_backup_setup>` for the whole site. A teacher with editing privileges can create a backup or download an existing backup for safe keeping, or for use on another Moodle site. 

Backing up a course
---------------------
To backup a course
  
 * Go to Administration > Course administration > Backup
 * Initial settings - Select activities, blocks, filters and other items as required then click the Next button. Users with appropriate permissions, such as administrators and managers, can choose whether to include users, anonymize user information, or include user role assignments, user files, comments, user completion details, course logs and grade history in the backup.
 * Schema settings - Select/deselect specific items to include in backup, then click the Next button. 
 * If desired, select specific types of activity to be backed up by clicking the link 'Show type options'.
