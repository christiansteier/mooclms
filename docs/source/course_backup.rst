Course Backup
==============
A course can be saved with some or all of its parts by using the course backup. Typically, the site administrator will set a schedule of :ref:`automated course backups <automated_backup_setup>` for the whole site. A teacher with editing privileges can create a backup or download an existing backup for safe keeping, or for use on another Moodle site.
