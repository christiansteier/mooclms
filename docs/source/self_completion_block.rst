Self completion block
======================
The self completion block provides a link for students to declare that they have completed the course. This maybe part of the :ref:`Course completion <course_completion>` requirements.

When a student believes they have completed the course, they click on the "Complete course" link in this block. 

Using the self completion block
--------------------------------
To allow a student to decide for themselves when they have completed a course, there are two requirements:

  * The completion tracking setting must have the "Manual Self Completion" box checked.
  * The Self completion block must be added to the course. 

The student may then click the "complete course link" in the block.

They are then asked to confirm they have completed the course and the course status will change to "complete" after the next Cron job. 

**Tip:** Cron is an important part of the course completion process. It basically re-compiles all the course completion reports.
