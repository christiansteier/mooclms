Youtube videos
===============
The Youtube repository allows users to search from within the HTML/TinyMCE editor for a youtube video which they can then embed without the need for any coding. The option needs to be enabled by the administrator before it is available for teachers and students. 
*NOTE: If the Youtube website is blocked in your institution then the videos will not display.*

Enabling the Youtube repository
--------------------------------
    1. Go to *Settings > Site administration > Plugins > Repositories > Manage Repositories*
    2. Select from the drop down next to Youtube "Enabled and visible";
    3. If desired,click on "Settings" and give Youtube a customised name (not essential) 
    
Searching for and embedding a video from youtube
--------------------------------------------------
    * Youtube videos can be searched for and embedded anywhere there is the HTML/TinyMCE editor, for example a label or a page.
    * Before this works, you must enable the multimedia filters under *Administration >Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters*. Set Multimedia Plugins to "On" and make sure youtube is selected under Settings (it should be by default).
    * Within a course you must ensure in Course administration>Filters that multimedia are ON.
    * Click the filmstrip, "Moodle media icon" in the editor: 
    * Click "Find or upload a sound, video or applet"
    * The file picker will appear with Youtube videos as an option. Click it and a search box will appear.
    * You can search by relevance, date or rating. Click the "Search" button when you are ready.
    * Your search results will appear as video thumbnails. 
    * Click "Insert"
    * DO NOT WORRY IF YOUR VIDEO NO LONGER SHOWS! You will just get a blue text link until you save. Then it will display. If it still displays as a text link after saving, make sure you have enabled the Multimedia filter as instructed at the top of this page.
