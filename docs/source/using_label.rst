Using label
============
A label is a versatile module that can serve a spacer between resources on a course page. It can provide a space for embedding banners, sound or video files or displaying code from Web 2.0 widgets.

Adding images to a label
-------------------------

Drag and drop images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Note:** this does not work with IE 9, Safari 6 or below or earlier versions of Firefox

  * Media drag and drop must be enabled in *Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > Label*.
  * With the editing turned on, drag your image into the section you want it to appear.
  * In the box that follows, choose "add image".
  * It will appear embedded in a label. 

Conventional method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  * Follow the instructions for :ref:`adding a label <label>`.
  * Click the image icon in the text editor.
  * Click "Find or upload an image".
  * Choose and upload your image using the filepicker.
  * Leave Common module settings at "show" if you wish the label to be visible.
  * Click "Save and return to course".
  
Adding text to a label
------------------------

Conventional method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As the label uses the Text editor it is straightforward to enter text and other required symbols and equations. It is however possible also to drag and drop text directly into a label.

  * Select the text you wish to use, for example in a Word document.
  * With the editing turned on, drag the text over to the section you want it to appear.
  * From the box that appears, choose "add a label" and then "upload". 

Adding a link to a label
-------------------------

Drag and drop links

  * From the box that appears, name the link and then click "upload". 

Adding sound or video to a label
---------------------------------
If multimedia filters are enabled, a label is a neat way of displaying sound or video in an inline player on the course page.

  * Follow the instructions for :ref:`adding a label <label>`
  * Click the media icon in the text editor 
  * Click "Find or upload an sound,video or applet"
  * Choose and upload your sound or video file using the filepicker.(Details on how to do this here)

  * Click "Save and return to course" 

Adding code to a label
-----------------------
An example of this is the ability to embed a Google map into a label.

  * Follow the instructions for :ref:`adding a label <label>`
  * Expand the toolbar and click the HTML icon in the text editor 
  * This brings up the screen in code (HTML) view.
  * Paste the code you grabbed from Google maps into this screen
  * Scroll down and click "Update" 
  * Leave Common module settings at "show" if you wish the label to be visible.
  * Click "Save and return to course" 

**Note:** The success in adding code to a label depends both on the type of code and the permissions of the user.
