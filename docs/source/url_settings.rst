URL

The URL module has additional settings which may be changed by an administrator in *Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > URL*.

Frame height
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you can specify the height of the top frame (containing the navigation) if you choose the "in frame" display option. Note:If your theme has a large header then the height should be increased to prevent horizontal and vertical scrollbars.

Require activity description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This setting allows you to turn off the requirement for users to type something into the description box.

Password
^^^^^^^^^
Here you can add a password that will connect your users to a secure site. See this forum post for more details.

Include role names in parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Available display options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This setting allows you to add different ways the resource may be displayed on the course page. There are a number of defaults but you can add or change them here. Other display options are:

    * In frame - show the Moodle heading and the file description, with the file displayed in a resizeable area below
    * New window - very much like 'in pop-up', but the new window is a full browser window, with menus and address bar, etc. 

Default values for activity settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here you can set the defaults for this resource.
