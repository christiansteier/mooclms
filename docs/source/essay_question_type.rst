Question grading
-----------------
The essay question will not be assigned a grade until it has been reviewed by a teacher and manually graded. Until that happens, the student's grade will be 0.

To grade a student's answer in a quiz, follow the 'manual grading' link under Results in *Administration > Quiz administration* in your course. When manually grading an essay question, the grader is able to enter a custom comment in response to the essay and assign a score for the essay.
