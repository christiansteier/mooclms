Courses
=======

A course in Moodle is an area where a teacher will add resources and activities for their students to complete. It might be a simple page with downloadable documents or it might be a complex set of tasks where learning progresses through interaction. Progress can be tracked in a number of ways.

Manage Courses and Categories
------------------------------


Add a Category
---------------
Most people organize their courses by department and college or by topic. Be sure to test the organizational scheme with a few users before entering a large number of courses, to save time in moving them later.

Adding categories is very simple:

    1. *Go to Administration > Site administration > Courses > Add a category*
    2. Complete the details required and click 'Create category.'
    3. Alternatively, you can go to Administration>Site administration>Courses>Manage courses and categories and click the link 'Create new category'.

If the category is visible, the course category description will be displayed to users when they enter the category, above the list of courses.
