Calculated question type
=========================
Calculated questions offer a way to create individual numerical questions by the use of wildcards (i.e you can use common variables names as **x , y** enclosed in curly braces to create the wildcards **{x}** and **{y}**) that are substituted with random values when the quiz is taken.

For example, if you want to create a large number of **"Calculate the area of a rectangle"** problems to drill your students, you could create a question with two wildcards (i.e. **{base}, {height}** created from the common **base, height** variable names) and put in the **"Correct Answer Formula="** input field **{base} * {height}** ( * being the multiplication sign ).
