Legacy course files
====================
In Moodle 2.0 onwards, files are stored in separate areas, rather than together in the course files area. When a site is upgraded from 1.9, the course files area is renamed 'Legacy course files'. By default, this area is not available in new courses.

*It is recommended that teachers make use of the new repositories in Moodle 2.0 for storing course files, rather than saving them in the legacy course files area.*

Enabling legacy course files areas
------------------------------------
To enable a legacy course files area in a new course

  1. Enable the legacy course files repository plugin in *Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Repositories > Manage repositories*.
  2. Check the legacyfilesinnewcourses box in the Manage repositories common settings then click the 'Save changes' button.
  3. Set 'Legacy course files' to Yes in the course settings. 

A legacy course files link will then appear in the *Administration > Course administration* area. 

Repository capabilities
-------------------------
The capabilities Use course files repository plugin and Manage files are both required for users to access the legacy course files area.
