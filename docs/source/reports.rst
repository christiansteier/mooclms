Reports

Comments
----------
A comments block can be added to any page in Moodle, enabling users to easily add comments. A similar interface enables comments to be added to glossary, database activity and blog entries. The comments interface uses AJAX so that comments are added instantly without needing a page refresh. 

Enabling comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Comments can be disabled/enabled by an administrator in Settings > Site administration > Advanced features. 

Blog comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Blog comments are enabled by default. The feature may be disabled in Site administration > Appearance > Blog.

Comments report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A list of all comments added may be found in Site administration > Reports > Comments.

Logs
-----
Logs in Moodle are activity reports. Logs are available at site and course level. 

To obtain course overview reports, you must first enable statistics. If you havenâ€™t got statistics enabled you will be taken to the enable statistics settings. You can choose to view reports of the most active courses or the most participatory courses over a certain time period. Results are displayed in a bar chart and in a table.



Live Logs
-----------
Live logs from the past hour (either for a course or for the site) are available via a link on the logs page. This allows you to define a number of parameters to run a report on activities within the system.

Live logs provide the following fields:

   * Course - course short name
   * Time - time of access
   * IP Address - unique user internet address
   * Full Name - name logged on with
   * Action - what they were doing
   * Information - any further information on the activity



Performance Overview
----------------------
The performance overview report in Administration > Site administration > Reports > Performance overview lists issues which may affect performance of the site. 



Question Instances
-------------------
An administrator can generate a question instances report in *Administration > Site administration > Reports > Question instances*. The Manager can also generate this report.

This report lists all the places a specific question type is used. It provides a list by course that shows the total, visible and hidden number of that question type. Clicking on a context link such as course title will take you to the relevant question in the question bank.

One practical use of this report is to find questions that may have inadvertently been created in a course which should have been created at the System default or a particular category context.
