The "docked" blocks appear as vertical tabs along the left margin attached to the page.

The docked block can expand into a menu with a click on the tab in the dock area. Clicking on the dock icon when a block is in the docked position, will move the block back to its original position.

Effect of using dock
----------------------
It allows users an option of changing the look of a page on their screen. For example, a student could move all blocks to the dock, creating a 1 column effect.
