The dock area with 5 docked blocks and a block with the dock tool

The "docked" blocks appear as vertical tabs along the left margin attached to the page. 

The docked block can expand into a menu with a click on the tab in the dock area. Clicking on the dock icon when a block is in the docked position, will move the block back to its original position.
