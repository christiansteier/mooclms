Forum
======
The forum module is an activity where students and teachers can exchange ideas by posting comments. There are four basic forum types. Forum posts can be graded by the teacher or other students. 

A forum can contribute significantly to successful communication and community building in an online environment. You can use forums for many innovative purposes in educational settings, but teaching forums and student forums are arguably the two more significant distinctions.

To add a forum:

  1. With the editing turned on, in the section you wish to add your forum, click the "Add an activity or resource" link (or, if not present, the "Add an activity" drop down menu )and choose *Forum*.
  2. This will take you to the forum settings page titled "Adding a new forum". 

In an existing forum, the following settings can be found in *Settings > Forum administration > Edit settings*.

**Forum name**

A short name of the forum (e.g. "Moodle"), which will be displayed on the course homepage.

**Forum type**

There are five forum types to choose from: 
  * **A single simple discussion** - A single topic discussion developed on one page, which is useful for short focused discussions (cannot be used with separate groups)
  * **Standard forum for general use** - An open forum where anyone can start a new topic at any time; this is the best general-purpose forum
  * **Each person posts one discussion** - Each person can post exactly one new discussion topic (everyone can reply to them though); this is useful when you want each student to start a discussion about, say, their reflections on the week's topic, and everyone else responds to these
  * **Q and A Forum** - Instead of initiating discussions teacher poses a question in the initial post of a discussion. Students may reply with an answer, but they will not see the replies of other Students to the question, until they have themselves replied to it.
  * **Standard forum displayed in a blog-like format**
  
A :ref:`News forum <news_forum>` is a special type of forum that is automatically created with a new course.
