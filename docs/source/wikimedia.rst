Wikimedia
==========
The Wikimedia repository enables a user to search Wikimedia and copy a selected file into Moodle.

When a file is chosen, Moodle displays the image dimensions, license, author, last modified date (and file size if it is smaller than the maximum dimension specified). 

Repository capabilities
-------------------------
There is just one capability, View wikimedia repository, which is allowed for the default authenticated user role.
