Building Quiz
==============

How a Moodle quiz works?
-------------------------
The word “quiz” might conjure up for some images of TV game shows, but a Moodle quiz is basically a set of questions presented to the learner which may be automatically marked by Moodle or graded later by the teacher. The questions may be in sentence or number form or contain various media such as video or sound. They do not all need to be the same type of questions: a quiz may contain multiple choice, matching, essays (teacher-graded) and calculated. Feedback may be given at any or all stages of the process.

If a quiz is a book, the Quiz settings are equivalent to the front cover; the quiz itself is contained within when the questions are created. (Be careful : once you have chosen the Quiz Settings, it will be “live” on your course page, unless you hide it, so your learners could potentially see a quiz with no questions, like a front cover with no content.)

Once a quiz has been added to the course and the Quiz settings established,the teacher can start to build the quiz. The teacher can access the quiz to edit the questions by clicking directly on the Quiz name on the course home page and then "Edit quiz" or by clicking the "info" link in the Navigation block. The "Edit quiz link can also be accessed from *Administration > Quiz administration*. 

Adding questions
------------------
Once you have accessed the quiz editing screen as above, you can add questions from a number of locations:

  1. Click the "Add question" button to begin a new question (1 below)
  2. Click "Show" (2a) to reveal the contents of the question bank (2b) and then choose a pre-made question or click "Create new question" (3)
  3. Click "Add a random question" to add a random question, *providing there are questions in the question bank already*.
