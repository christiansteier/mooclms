Embedded files
===============
The embedded files repository allows users to access files such as images which they have previously embedded into the TinyMCE text editor. This makes it more convenient, for example, to quickly re-use images in a label or page. It complements the TinyMCE Manage embedded files plugin, which allows files embedded in the editor to be deleted or overwritten.

Embedded files repository
---------------------------
    * This repository can be accessed when using the TinyMCE text editor and inserting images, videos or creating hyperlinks.
    * The first time a file is added, it is added from the usual repositories, for example Upload a file.
    * It will then become available for reuse in the same text area from the Embedded files repository.
