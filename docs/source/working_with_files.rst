Working with files
===================

 * Moodle provides an easy way for a teacher to present materials to their students. These materials may take the form of files such as word-processed documents or slideshow presentations. The material can be displayed on the page either as individual items or bundled together inside folders. One teacher might for instance wish to share a single research documents in pdf format; another might have a folder of sample past examination papers for students to download.
 * Most types of files can be uploaded and accessed through Moodle but the students needs to have the correct software to be able to open them.
 
Viewing uploaded files
-----------------------
 * Once uploaded, files appear as thumbnails in the file manager for easy recognition.
 * Files view can be easily toggled between icons view or a table view with sizes and dates, or a hierarchical list view.

Editing or updating uploaded files
------------------------------------
 * Clicking on the name of an uploaded file opens up a pop up dialogue box which allows file details quickly to be altered.

Creating an alias / shorcut

 * When an uploaded file - or a file from the Private files, Dropbox, File system or EQUELLA repositories - is re-used elsewhere on Moodle, the teacher has the option to make a copy (a new, unconnected version) or to create a shortcut or *alias*.
 * If an alias is created, then when the original file is updated, it will change in all instances of the alias. So a teacher might add course notes to their private files for example, and then add them into a number of courses. When the teacher makes an alteration in the file in their private files, this alteration will be reflected in all instances of the course notes.
 * An alias can be recognised by its thumbnail. See the difference in the screenshot below between the original file (left) and the alias (right).
 
Area in which aliases cannot be made
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An alias cannot be made in the following areas of Moodle:

  * an assignment submission
  * a forum post attachment
  * a workshop submission
  * a quiz essay
  * a database activity file field 
  
This is to prevent cases such as a student uploading an item for assessment and then subsequently changing the original in their private files. When a student uses a file from their private files in one of these instances, they do not see the options to "copy" or "create an alias". Below is an example of a file added to an assignment.
