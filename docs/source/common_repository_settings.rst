Common Repository Settings
===========================
Common repository settings can be set by an administrator in *Administration > Site administration > Plugins > Repositories > Common Repository settings*:

Cache Expire
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can specify how long in seconds file listings are cached locally when browsing external repositories.

Allow external links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With some repositories such as Flickr and Wikimedia, users can have the choice whether to copy the media into Moodle (the preferred solution) or to make a link to it instead.

Legacy course files in new courses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This repository is not normally available in new courses as it is designed for upgraded 1.9 courses. However, if it is checked here then it will appear when new courses are created - but certain backup and restore features won't work with it. See Legacy course files for more details.

Allow adding to legacy course files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When 'Legacy course files' is available in a course, this setting controls if users are able to add new files to it. When enabled, users will be able to add files and directories, as well as delete. When disabled, users will not be able to add files and directories.
