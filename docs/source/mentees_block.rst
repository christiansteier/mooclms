Mentees block
===============
A Mentees block is a frontpage block that provides mentors with quick access to their mentee(s) profile page(s). A mentor might be a parent for example who has access to their child's information through the link in the block.

Block visibility
------------------
The mentees block does not become visible until individual “mentors” have been assigned a role that enables them to mentor other users who become their "mentees" (e.g., a parent mentoring a child, or a tutor mentoring a student). To assign a mentor to a mentee, the mentor must first be assigned a role that allows that mentor permission to view relevant user information (moodle/user:viewdetails set to allow). After having been assigned a role that grants viewing permission, the mentor’s role must then be assigned to the mentee/user whose information they wish to view.

Mentor users logging on to the site will then be presented with a mentees block containing names and links to information about the individual users the mentor has been granted authorization to view.
