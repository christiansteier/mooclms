Page
=====
A page resource creates a link to a screen that displays the content created by the teacher. The robust Text editor allows the page to display many different kinds of content such as plain text, images, audio, video, embedded code or a combination of all these. 

In certain cases it might be preferable to use the page resource instead of uploading a word-processed document, particularly if the document contains text that is just to be read and not downloaded. 

Adding a new page
------------------
  1. From the the "Add an activity or resource" link (or, if not present, the "Add a resource" drop down menu),choose Page
  2. In the "Adding a new page" screen that follows, give your page a name and a description (which may or may not be required according to admin settings)
  3. Add your content to the Page content section. 

Display options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can choose to display the page name or not, and by clicking on Advanced Settings can choose whether to display its description or not. (Whether or not you see these options depends on your admin settings.) There is also an option to display the page description on the course page below the link to the page.
