Upload user pictures
=====================

Every user on Moodle is able to have their own personal profile picture (or "avatar") which can be uploaded via their profile. If no picture has been uploaded then the default is shown.

Updating user picture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can update their picture by editing their user profile  in *Settings > My profile > Edit profile*.

    * TThere is a delete box when checked will delete the picture when the profile is saved.
    * TThere is a browse button for the user to find and upload a picture file.
    * TThe picture description appears when the mouse rolls over the picture.

Uploading user pictures in bulk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An administrator can upload a zip file containing user images in *Settings > Site administration > Users > Accounts > Upload user pictures*.

    * The image files should be named after the username, the idnumber or the id of the student (along with the correct image file extension.) For example, a student with the username jbrown98 would have a picture called jbrown98.jpg
    * TImage types supported include gif, jpg, and png.
    * TImage file names are not case sensitive.

Gravatars
^^^^^^^^^^

An administrator can enable the use of gravatars in *Settings > Site administration > Users > Permissions > User policies*. If a user has not uploaded a user picture, Moodle will check whether the user's email address has an associated gravatar and if so, will use the gravatar as the user's picture.
