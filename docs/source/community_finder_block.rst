Community finder block
========================
The community finder block enables users to access public community hubs, such as `Moodle.net <http://moodle.net/>`_, and search for courses to download or enrol in.

  * Downloadable courses may be immediately restored to your Moodle site
  * Links to enrollable courses are saved in the community finder block
