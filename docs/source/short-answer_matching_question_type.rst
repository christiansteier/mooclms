Random Short-answer Matching question type
===========================================
Note: The Random Short-Answer Matching question type is broken in Moodle versions 2.6 and 2.6.1, and can be used again starting from Moodle 2.6.2.

  * From the student perspective, this looks just like a Matching question. The difference is that the sub-questions are drawn randomly from the Short Answer questions in the current category (including or not subcategories from the current category).
  * After an optional introduction, the respondent is presented with two or more sub-questions, each with a drop-down menu box opposite listing the same number (or fewer if several sub-questions have the same answer) of available answer options.
  * The respondent must select an answer option to match each sub-question.
  * Each sub-question is equally weighted to contribute towards the grade for the total question.
  * The questions and answers are randomly drawn from the pool of short-answer questions in the current category (and in its subcategories if this option was selected).
  * You must make sure that the category contains enough short-answer questions, otherwise the student will get an error message. The more short-answer questions you add to the category, the more likely it is that students will see a new selection on each attempt. Short answers questions used in a previous attempt to the same question or in another Random Short-Answer question of the same quiz are not excluded, so you should ensure there are enough Short Answer questions in the category to mitigate the risk of a student getting the same questions and answers.
  * Note that the answer options are taken from the correct (having a 100% grade) answers of each contributing short-answer question. If there are several answers to the sort-answer question with a 100% grade, the first one is used. Therefore, if the short-answer questions in this category are on different topics, this question type will not be useful, as the correct option will be obvious. 


An example that doesn't work - suppose the category contains 2 short-answer questions, as follows:

+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. What is the capital of France?                             |
|  Correct answer: Paris                                        |
|  Other recognised answers: Lyon, Marseilles, *                |
| 2. What vegetable is called 'l√∏k' in Norway?                  |
|  Correct answer: Onion                                        |
|  Other recognised answers: Leek, *                            |
