Using Forum
============
The teacher can set the format of what the student sees under the introduction by selecting the forum type in Forum settings. 

Views
------

**A single simple discussion**

Students will see the text you have placed in the Forum introduction setting as the first post of the discussion. Below you will find the replies that have been posted. In the example below, the student sees that their reply was rated. 

**Each person posts one discussion**

The view will be basically the same as in the previous case, the only difference being the 'Add a new discussion' option. Viewing a forum page, the student will see the text you have written at the 'Forum introduction' space while creating the forum, and, if there are any, the discussions that have been started. 

**Standard forum for general use**

In this forum type, students will see the introduction text in a separate space above the discussion field, in which you will see the information such as the title of the discussion (which means the forum's title), its author, the number of replies and the date of the last post. 

**Question and Answer forum**

The Q & A forum is best used when you have a particular question that you wish to have answered. In a Q and A forum, teachers post the question and students respond with possible answers. By default a Q and A forum requires students to post once before viewing other students' postings.

**Standard forum displayed in blog-like format**
 
In the upper right corner of the home forum screen (above the introduction), the student may see the options the teacher has set for subscriptions to the forum, and the 'Jump to' field, with which you can 'jump' to any part of the course. This is also place where the teacher will find the "Update this forum" button.
