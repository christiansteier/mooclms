Server files
=============
The server files repository enables teachers and managers to access files used within a course and elsewhere on the site which they have permission to access.

Activity modules for which files are available in the server files repository are:

    * File resource
    * Folder resource
    * Database
    * Forum
    * Glossary
    * Lesson 
    
When a file from the server files repository is re-used elsewhere on Moodle, the teacher has the option to make a copy (a new, unconnected version) or to create a shortcut or alias.
