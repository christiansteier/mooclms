Folder
=======
A folder allows a teacher to display several course resources together. The resources may be of different types and they may be uploaded in one go, as a zipped folder which is then unzipped, or they may be added one at a time to an empty folder on the course page. 

Using a folder to display resources is neater than displaying files one by one in a list. It takes up less space on the course page.

The downside is that at present you are forced to download files stored in a folder resource. You cannot have (for example) a folder of pictures where the user can view the pictures in Moodle without a download. 

Adding a folder
-----------------
**Note:** Folders you wish to upload to Moodle have to be "zipped" or "compressed" first. The way you do this depends on your computer and operating system.

If you already have a folder of files you would like to display, there are two methods:

Quick method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Click the 'Turn editing on' button at the top right of the course page
    Drag and drop the folder onto the course section where you'd like it to appear
    Click the button of the action you would like to take with the folder (in our case, "Unzip") and click "Upload"
    If necessary, edit the title of the folder by clicking the pencil icon 

Longer method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Click the 'Turn editing on' button at the top right of the course page
    Click 'Add an activity or resource' link, then in the activity chooser; select folder then click the "Add" button (or select folder from the "Add a resource" dropdown menu) All settings may expanded by clicking the "Expand all" link top right.
