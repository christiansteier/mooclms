Filters
========
Filters can be used to add links, insert multimedia players, convert Mathematical expressions or emoticons into images and more.

A filter may be enabled at the site level and then removed as needed at the course or activity level. Thus a teacher can disable glossary auto-linking in a quiz for example. 

Standard filters
------------------
Filters in Moodle include:

 * **Activity names auto-linking** - It is a site Filter that will create links to an activity where the word or phrase of the activity is used within the same course in which the activity is located. This includes forum postings, pages, labels etc. 
 * **Algebra notation** - This filter will convert algebra code into GIF images
 * **Convert URLs into links** - This filter converts URLs in selected formats, such as Moodle auto-format, to click-able links
 * **Database auto-linking** - As the name suggests, this filter enables automatic linking of Database module entries
 * **Display emoticons as images** - This converts emoticon (smiley) characters into images
 * **Email protection** - This obfuscates email address links to make them more difficult for spammers to harvest
 * **Glossary auto-linking** - This scans text for glossary entries that exist in the same course and creates a link
 * **Multimedia plugins** - This finds a link in text that points to a multimedia resource and replaces the link with an appropriate multimedia player code which can play the resource
 * **Multi-language content** - This filter enables resources to be created in multiple languages
 * **TeX notation** - The TeX Filter is a core Moodle filter intended to allow one to convert tex expressions into GIF images.
 * **Word censorship** - This filter "blacks out" words found on a list
