Import course data
====================
Course activities and resources may be imported from any other course that the teacher has editing permissions in. This will allow teachers to re-use instead of re-creating one or more :ref:`activities <activities>` or :ref:`resources <resources>`.

Import course data is similar to a backup and restore process and does not include any user data. 

How to import activities or resources
---------------------------------------
 * In *Administration > Course Administration*, click on the *Import* link.
