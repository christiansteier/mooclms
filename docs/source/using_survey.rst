Using Survey
=============
Once students have begun to answer the survey questions, the teacher may track the survey results via the "View xx survey responses" link at the top right of the page.

The teacher may also download the results from the survey, from the View Survey Responses page, by following the Download link. Results may be downloaded in .ODS, excel or Text formats. 

Survey report
---------------
The survey report section in each survey allows you to view the data by course, by student, or by question. You can also download the data as a spreadsheet or text file.

Note: Moodle surveys are not anonymous. While students cannot see each other's results, you can view each student's survey. There is no way to assure anonymity. If you are using these results for research, you must develop a scheme to download the data and assign participant numbers. You should also inform students of this limitation.

  * The COLLES and ATTLS questions are five-point scales that range in responses from Almost Always to Almost Never. These results are reported in graphical form when you view them.
  * The Critical Incidents survey is a free-response survey where students must type their answers. You can see what students have typed for each answer.
